## Open Yoga in Munich

This is the source code of our [old home page][1]. We used [Jekyll][2] as a static site generator and a heavily modified version of the default theme minima with a sidebar. This means that the source code is [MIT][3] licensed and the content falls under regular copyright laws.

Our [new home page][4] is based on [Hugo][5] and hosted under a different domain.
